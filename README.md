# PPMTF
This is a source code of PPMTF (Privacy-Preserving Multiple Tensor Factorization): https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04226.

PPMTF is implemented with C++ (data preprocessing and evaluation are implemented with Python). This software is released under the MIT License.

# Directory Structure
- cpp/
  - cpp codes (put the required files under this directory; see README.txt).
- data/
  - Data of PF/FS (output by running codes).
- python/
  - python codes.

# Usage
**[NOTE]: To synthesize traces in PF and FS using PPMTF, run only (1)-(3).**

**(1) Install**

Install Eigen 3.3.7, Generalized Constant Expression Math, and StatsLib (see cpp/README.txt).

Install PPMTF (C++) as follows.
```bash
cd cpp/
make
```

**(2) Synthesizing traces in PF (SNS-based people flow data) using PPMTF**

Download the [SNS-based people flow data](https://nightley.jp/archives/1954/).

Run the following commands.

```bash
cd python/
python3 Read_PF.py [PF directory (including the people flow data files in Tokyo)] TK
python3 MakeTrainTestData_PF.py TK
python3 MakeTrainTensor.py PF TK
cd ../cpp/
./PPMTF PF TK 200
(To change the alpha paramter from 200 to [alpha], run "./PPMTF PF TK [alpha]".)
./SynData_PPMTF PF TK 10
```

Then synthesize traces in PF are generated by PPMTF under data/PF/.

To evaluate the utility and privacy of the synthetic traces, run the following command.

```bash
./EvalUtilPriv.py PF TK PPMTF
```

Then the results are output under data/PF/.

**(3) Synthesizing traces in FS (Foursquare dataset) using PPMTF**

Download the [Foursquare dataset (Global-scale Check-in Dataset with User Social Networks)](https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset).

Under the FS directory (including the Foursquare data files), run the following command (to fix garbled text).

```bash
cat raw_POIs.txt | sed -e "s/Caf[^.]*\t/Caf\t/" > raw_POIs_fix.txt
```

Run the following commands.

```bash
cd python/
python3 Read_FS.py [FS directory (including the Foursquare data files)] NY
python3 MakeTrainTestData_FS.py NY
python3 MakeTrainTensor.py PF NY
cd ../cpp/
./PPMTF FS NY
./SynData_PPMTF FS NY 1
./PDTest_Trace FS NY 1.0 10 32000 1
```

Then synthesize traces in NYC (New York City) are generated by PPMTF under data/FS/.

To evaluate the utility and privacy of the synthetic traces, run the following command.

```bash
./EvalUtilPriv.py FS NY PPMTF
```

Then the results are output under data/FS/.

Synthesized traces in other cities (IST/JK/KL/SP/TKY) can also be generated and evaluated by replacing NY with IS, JK, KL, SP, or TK.

**(4) Synthesizing traces in PF/FS using SGD**

Run the following commands.

```bash
./SynData_SGD PF TK 10 0
(To change the number of copied events from 0 to [CopyNum], run "./SynData_SGD PF TK 10 [CopyNum]".)
./SynData_SGD FS NY 1
```

Then synthesize traces in PF and NYC are generated by SGD under data/PF and data/FS/, respectively.

To evaluate the utility and privacy of the synthetic traces, run the following command.

```bash
./EvalUtilPriv.py PF TK SGD
./EvalUtilPriv.py FS NY SGD
```

Then the results are output under data/PF/ or data/FS/.

Synthesized traces in other cities (IST/JK/KL/SP/TKY) can also be generated and evaluated by replacing NY with IS, JK, KL, SP, or TK.

**(5) Synthesizing traces in PF using SGLT**

Download the [SGLT (sglt-v0.1a.tgz)](https://vbinds.ch/node/70).

Run the following command to make input files for SGLT.

```bash
python3 MakeSGLPMInput_PF.py
```

Run SGLT to synthesize traces (see README in SGLT for the usage).

Run the following command to combine the synthetic traces into one file.

```bash
python3 MakeSGLPMOutput_PF.py [sg-LPM directory] 500 10
```

Move the synthetic trace file (output by MakeSGLPMOutput_PF.py) to data/PF/SGLT_TK/ as follows.
```bash
mkdir data/PF/SGLT_TK
mv [synthetic trace file] data/PF/SGLT_TK
```

To evaluate the utility and privacy of the synthetic traces, run the following command.

```bash
./EvalUtilPriv.py PF TK SGLT
```
